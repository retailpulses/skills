## What This File Is

- An entrypoint that agents must read before database-related work.
- A pointer to the canonical central policy, which is the source of truth.
- This file may be updated by `rp-governance-install` during governance upgrades.

## What This File Is Not

- A copy of the full canonical policy.
- A replacement for `docs/DATABASE_OWNERSHIP.yaml`.
- A replacement for `docs/DATABASE_WORKLOADS.yaml`.
- A substitute for the repository-specific declarations in `docs/16_DATABASE_GOVERNANCE.local.md`.

## Minimal Local Declaration

Each business repository should contain only a minimal local declaration. Do not copy the complete governance document into each repository. The pattern:

```markdown
## Database governance

Canonical policy: `retailpulses/rp-governance-kit`

This repository:
- does not own migrations for the `<domain>` domain;
- may use approved server-side read paths declared in the central registry;
- must not expose privileged database credentials to frontend code;
- must follow production activation controls for writing or high-risk workloads.

Repository-specific details are documented locally.
```

Governance defines ownership, capabilities, privilege boundaries, and production risk controls. Business repositories choose implementation details within those approved boundaries. Central prose edits do not require downstream repository updates.

## Agent Instructions

1. Before any Supabase, migration, schema, RLS, Storage, or generated-types work, read this file.
2. Follow the canonical policy at `docs/DATABASE_GOVERNANCE.md` in `rp-governance-kit`.
3. Read `docs/16_DATABASE_GOVERNANCE.local.md` for repository-specific declarations and exemptions.
4. Read `docs/DATABASE_OWNERSHIP.yaml` in `rp-governance-kit` for domain ownership.
5. Read `docs/DATABASE_WORKLOADS.yaml` in `rp-governance-kit` before running any recurring or bulk database workload.
6. Read `docs/DATABASE_INCIDENT_RESPONSE.md` in `rp-governance-kit` before performing any emergency database action.
7. If this file conflicts with the canonical central policy, stop and report the conflict. The central policy wins unless this repository's rules are stricter.
8. If the installed governance ref recorded here differs from the canonical `@main`, report the version skew before proceeding.

## Repository Declaration

See `docs/16_DATABASE_GOVERNANCE.local.md` for this repository's specific declaration:

- **Supabase consumer:** yes / no
- **Migration owner:** yes / no
- **Owned domains:** (from `DATABASE_OWNERSHIP.yaml`)
- **Consumed shared domains:** (from `DATABASE_OWNERSHIP.yaml`)
- **Generated types:** path or exemption
- **Deployment authority:** who can approve hosted writes
- **Database environment model:** shared / dedicated / local-only

## Repository Workload Declaration

Repositories that contain database-writing code (Workers, scripts, cron jobs, syncs, imports) must maintain a section in `docs/16_DATABASE_GOVERNANCE.local.md` declaring each workload:

- **Workload ID:** unique identifier matching an entry in `docs/DATABASE_WORKLOADS.yaml` (canonical registry)
- **Category:** imports | syncs | backfills | scheduled_jobs | agent_operations | maintenance | diagnostics
- **Risk level:** low | medium | high
- **Trigger:** cron expression, manual, event-driven, or on-deploy
- **Kill-switch method:** how to abort safely
- **Approval:** who authorized this workload in this repository
- **Workload declaration reference:** link to the corresponding entry in `DATABASE_WORKLOADS.yaml` or the Issue that authorized a one-off workload
- **Egress contract:** for scheduled/bulk reads, stable client identity, explicit projection, pagination/cursor strategy, measured per-run/day response-byte budgets, and thresholds

Workloads that do not yet have a canonical registry entry in `DATABASE_WORKLOADS.yaml` must be declared as one-off in `docs/16_DATABASE_GOVERNANCE.local.md` with the same fields, and an Issue must be filed to register them in the canonical registry.

Repositories that do not host any database-writing workloads should state:

> **Workload declaration:** This repository has no database-writing workloads. All database access is read-only. Production writing workloads are declared in the central workload registry.

## Quick Reference

| Rule | Summary |
|------|---------|
| Migration naming | `YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_description.sql` — unique across all Retailpulses repos |
| Migration header | Domain, owner, affected objects, change class, hosted write required |
| Access classes | `worker_only`, `authenticated_user`, `public_read`, `internal_admin` |
| RLS | Evaluated against declared access class; `worker_only` may have no client policies |
| Hosted writes | Require explicit approval; never combine audit and remediation |
| CLI | CI must pin version; local version recorded in `.local.md` |
| Generated types | Required for direct Supabase clients; exemption available for API-only consumers |
| Workload registry | Recurring workloads must be registered in `DATABASE_WORKLOADS.yaml` |
| N+1 prohibition | No per-record DB/API lookups in loops; use bulk retrieval; declare max_requests_per_invocation and max_requests_per_1000_input_rows |
| Egress control | Scheduled/bulk reads use stable client identity, explicit columns, cursor decision, response-byte budgets, and client-side byte metrics |
| Change-aware writes | Periodic scans must not rewrite unchanged rows for per-row timestamps; prefer run-level freshness |
| Access path | Every workload must declare `postgrest`, `supavisor`, `internal_api`, or `direct_postgres`; consumers may use any approved server-side path |
| Release mapping | Scheduled production workloads must map to a reviewed Git commit; no untracked VPS source |
| Rollout gates | High-risk: zero-write dry-run → bounded canary → manual full run → ≥2 healthy scheduled cycles |
| Run health independence | Current-run health not based on historical alerts; separate this-run metrics from known debt |
| Batch safety | Max 10,000 rows per statement; cursor-based pagination for reads over 100k rows |
| Retries | Max 3 per unit of work; exponential backoff with jitter |
| Kill switches | Documented and tested for every Medium/High workload |
| Observability | Capture: requests by operation, rows read/compared, business_rows_changed, rows_written, unchanged_rows_written, unchanged_write_ratio, batches, runtime, retries/dead letters |
| Incident response | See `DATABASE_INCIDENT_RESPONSE.md`; capture evidence before mitigation |
